## Usage

This application can be used to learn about me. The functional navigation bar will take you to the appropriate section on the page when you click the links. You can see the image of my wife, our dog, and I. Under this image there is a couple paragraphs explaining big points of my life. When you navigate to the work section you will see titled images that are linked to the appropriate deployed work. At the bottom of the page there is all of my contact information.
